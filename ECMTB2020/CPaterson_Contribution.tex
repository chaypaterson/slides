\maketitle

Vestibular schwannomas are benign central nervous system tumours. When treated
with radiotherapy, the tumours may become malignant instead of being
successfully treated. By developing a mathematical model in close collaboration
with clinical geneticists, we can hypothesise that malignancy must be caused by
at least one tumour suppressor, rather than an oncogene; and can also constrain
the size and location of this unknown gene [1]. Futhermore, there should be an
interesting mathematical relation between aneuploidy in schwannomas in the
general population, and the risk of schwannoma in populations affected by a certain rare
genetic disorder [2].
