Main additions:
    * add bit on intuition for why the wave equation works
    * KFE/master eqn has a local causal structure in state space
    * small changes to the probability will propagate outwards
    * regenerate porkchop plots
    * add videos

Also reorder slides:
    * delete first intro slide
    * move graphs after study description
    * "so what" --> "diagnosis free survival: the relevant curve"
        * also move the graph off that slide to the next
