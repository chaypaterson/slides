Target: 20-25 slides

Removable: slides on radiation, warning slide, definition of cancer

Intro: Armitage-Doll: age-incidence data

Main PROBLEM: want to predict prob. of cancer by age t.
    Three SOLUTIONS:
        Gillespie algorithm (v. slow but exact)
        Luebeck-Moolgavkar quadrature (v. fast but doesn't work on graphs)
        Mean field approximation (v. fast but inaccurate)

Could add/mention: integer partitions

Change: nOGX --> nGFX

Add: description of new algorithm!
    How much faster it is
    To the same accuracy, new runtime ~ old runtime ^{1/6}

Add: demonstrate with a graph of computed incidence
