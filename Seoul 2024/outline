Evolution on graphs and the transition to cancer

Big question of the talk: when do driver mutations occur? How can we capture
different orders and the explosive randomness of biology?

Intro:
    Differential equations:
    * below a certain scale, the structure of a material or field is
    * unimportant, and it behaves as a continuum.
    * Examples:
    * Fluid mechanics and acoustics
    Driver mutations:
    * less than 5 SNVs in a single strand of DNA can result in enormous
      phenotypic changes.
    * Examples:
    * COVID-19 jumping to humans from animals
    * Brain tumours (majority of cancers are clonal, descending from a single cell)

    * We can't seriously believe that differential equations can meaningfully
      capture this kind of explosive evolution. Except for setting initial
      conditions, differential equations are too deterministic to describe
      the enormous effect of mutation + selection -- the initial
      conditions only become knowable when it is too late, and the patient is
      already dead. I think we are just hoping that because diff eqs. are
      understood well, and biology is understood poorly, that our understanding
      of maths will "infect" biology and make biology better understood by
      association.
