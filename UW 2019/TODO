Changes to be made from last year's talk:
    Include bit on simulations of both kinds at the start
    Rewrite to include our generalised McKendrick-von Foerster eqns
        Standardise form of equations: diff. eqs. should be analytic
        Boundary conditions should be more complicated than Cauchy
        Solution method should be done in terms of Laplace transforms
        (NOT variation of parameters!)
    Include our solutions for <n> and numerical comparison
        (maybe a bit on generating functions)
    Finally, include some discussion of experimental study on recurrence in
        specific therapies

    Stylistic points:
        More minimalistic slide layout. No links or name etc.
        More whitespace on slides: EITHER image OR list.

20 minutes at ~2 mins per slide = about 10 slides.
